 How to configure spring-framework?

    3 ways

    1. XML

            - centralized configuration

        disadvantages:

             - more verbose
             - very difficult express dynamic configuration over XML document

    2. Annotation

        advantages:

            - concise, simple to use over java code

        disadvantages:

            - configuration scattered over many java-files
            - we can use annotation java code that we write

    3. Java-Config

        - overcome limitations of XML & Annotation config


     conclusion:

        best approach:


            - Annotation + Java-based configuration
